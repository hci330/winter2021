 * 1. Create and attach an event handler (function) to each .image 
 * element so that when the .image element is clicked, the corresponding 
 * image loads in the .featured_image element.
 * 
 * 2. Create event handlers for the next and previous buttons so that you 
 * can easily see each image in sequence.
 * 
 * 3. If you get to the end, start at the beginning. 
 * 
 * 4. If you get to the beginning, loop around to the end.
