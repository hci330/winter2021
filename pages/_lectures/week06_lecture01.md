Today, we're going to be talking about user research using **qualitative** methods. While there are many different methods for conducting user research, we will be focusing on two:
1. Interviews
2. Contextual Inquiry

To get a little background on these topics, please read the articles/guides (below). While reading, consider the following questions:

* What are the benefits of interviewing users in context?
* What are some characteristics of effective interview questions?
