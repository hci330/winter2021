* Spotify: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-spotify-recommends-your-new-favorite-artist-8c1850512af0 
* There are three recommendation models at work on Spotify:
* Collaborative filtering: Uses your behavior and that of similar users.
* Natural Language Processing (NLP): For song lyrics, playlists, blog posts, social media comments.
Audio models: Used on raw audio.
