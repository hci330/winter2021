As described in the [syllabus](../syllabus/), you must complete/attend **at least five lab sessions** (4 points each) by the end of the quarter. There are two ways to earn full participation credit in each lab session:

1. By attending them (synchronously), working through the exercises, and asking questions (as they arise).
2. By turning in the lab exercise(s) ***before*** the lab session. Lab exercises will be posted at the beginning of the week (at least 48 hours in advance).

No late submissions will be accepted.
