## What is HCI?
Human computer interaction (HCI) is a broad, interdisciplinary field that studys how people and computers interact in the world. These interactions can be examined at various scales -- from fine-grained user experiences, to the ways in which computing shapes (and is shaped by) individuals, institutions, and society. 

HCI draws on knowledge and expertise from many different disciplines and domains (e.g. computer science, engineering, the social sciences and humanities, and many more).  Within computer science, HCI tends to focus on how to design and build useful technologies that solve problems and enable new possibilities, given a domain and a problem space. This involves:

* ***data considerations*** -- to consider how and why data are constructed from real-world phenomena, the strengths and limitations of particular models, and whether and how particular data methods and techniques are appropriate for a given real-world application.
* ***design considerations*** -- to understand the problem space and user needs; apply research-informed methods and principles for designing accessible, intuitive, and useful interfaces; and explore how emerging technologies could be applied in novel ways. 

That said, HCI extends beyond designing and building new technologies. In fact, much of HCI involves taking stock of how computing infrastructures interact with individuals, institutions, and society more broadly across a wide range of human experiences (relationships, mental health and wellness, politics, fairness and accountability, sustainability, and so forth). In other words, describing, reflecting, critiquing, and debating the role of computing in society are also integral components of HCI (in addition to designing and building interfaces).

## About This Course
In this course (MSAI Edition), we will focus on HCI principles as they relate to data intensive systems. We will do this from the perspective of three roles that you may take on in your future work as AI experts:

* ***The data practitioner*** -- someone who thinks about how data resources are designed and utilized to support critical user interactions.
* ***The interface designer*** -- someone who considers how user interactions ought to be designed to support various use cases, so that the system has value to the people who use it.
* ***The manager*** -- someone who thinks about the 'big picture,' including how all of the pieces fit together, the value propositions offered by the system, and the economic, social, and ethical dimensions of the system architecture. 

### Tentative Schedule
This is a new version of CS330, which is intended to be tailored to MSAI students and students who are interested in the social and human aspects of AI systems. As such, many of these lectures, readings, and labs are subject to change based on your experiences and feedback. It is your responsibility to keep up with the course and any schedule changes. The course is divided into three units: (1) data, (2) user interfaces, and (3) special topics in HCI/AI. 

#### 1. Data
In the first unit, we will focus on some of the human aspects of working with data: what it represents, how it's made, and what interactions it supports.

### Coursework
#### 1. Team Project
The heart of this course is a quarter-long project. You will work in teams to design and test a novel user interface around and idea of your team's choosing. App design is an iterative process; you will build and test successively higher-fidelity prototypes over the quarter. Students who are not registered for course credit may not participate in the project.

#### 2. Individual Homework Assignments
You will also work on individual homework assignments throughout the quarter. These assignments will be pretty varied -- some will be coding assignments to get you familiar with different technologies and design methods. Some will be written assignments that will ask you to analyze existing systems or examine a series of case studies. All of these assignments are intended to help you develop your thinking about design decisions and their tradeoffs. 

#### 3. Lectures
I have selected course readings to deepen and expand your understanding of HCI fundamentals beyond what we cover in lecture. You are ex

#### 4. Weekly Labs
On Fridays, you will be doing short activities and tutorials in your lab section. Some of the labs will help you install, configure, and build a 'full stack web application.' Other labs will involve designing, building, and testing versions of your final project. Lab attendance is required, but you may miss one lab without a grade penalty.

#### 5. Readings
I have selected course readings to deepen and expand your understanding of HCI fundamentals beyond what we cover in lecture. You are ex....

### Expectations
#### Engagement
* You will come to class prepared and ready to engage in an intellectual discussion about the readings and labs.
* You will complete all assignments on time and with interest, engagement, and intellectual curiosity.
* You will be strong contributor to your team when doing group work.
* You will bring your unique expertise, perspectives, and experiences to class and share them with others, so that we might all gain from your perspectives.
* You will respect and seek to understand the unique perspectives and experiences of others.
* You will give your classmates the benefit of the doubt (about their competence and intentions) and can expect the same from them.
* All work that you submit will be your own original work; you will cite others’ work where appropriate.

#### Assessment
Your course grade is calculated based on 200 points as follows:

{:.medium}
| **2 Projects** | 2 x 40 Points | 80 Points | 40% |
| **2 Quizzes** (of 3) | 2 x 30 Points (lowest score dropped) | 60 Points | 30% |
| **5 Homeworks** (of 6) | 5 x 8 Points (lowest score dropped) | 40 Points | 20% |
| **7 Tutorials** (of 9) | 7 x ~3 Points (lowest scores dropped) | 20 Points | 10% |
| | | **200 Points** | **100%** |

Final grades are assigned on a fixed scale: 93-100 is 
an A, 90-92.99 is an A-, 87-89.99 is a B+, etc. Some other logistics:

1. Final course grades will not be rounded or curved.
1. We will not be using the final exam time for this class.

## A Note on Class Recordings
The Provost's office has asked instructors to publish the following language in the syllabus:

> ### Class Recordings
> This class or portions of this class may be recorded by the instructor for educational purposes. These recordings will be shared only with students enrolled in the course and will be deleted at the end of the Spring Quarter, 2020 course. Your instructor will communicate how you can access the recordings.
>
> ### Policy On Unauthorized Student Recording of Classroom or other Academic Activities
> Unauthorized student recording of classroom or other academic activities (including advising sessions or office hours) is prohibited. Unauthorized recording is unethical and may also be a violation of University policy and state law. Students requesting the use of assistive technology as an accommodation should contact AccessibleNU. Unauthorized use of classroom recordings — including distributing or posting them — is also prohibited.  
>
> Under the University’s Copyright Policy, faculty own the copyright to instructional materials — including those resources created specifically for the purposes of instruction, such as syllabi, lectures and lecture notes, and presentations.  Students cannot copy, reproduce, display or distribute these materials. Students who engage in unauthorized recording, unauthorized use of a recording or unauthorized distribution of instructional materials will be referred to the appropriate University office for follow-up.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
Any student requesting accommodations related to a disability or other condition is required to register with AccessibleNU (847-467-5530) and provide professors with an accommodation notification from AccessibleNU, preferably within the first two weeks of class. All information will remain confidential.
