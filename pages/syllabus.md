## About the Course
Human computer interaction (HCI) is a broad, interdisciplinary field that draws on knowledge and expertise from many different disciplines and domains (e.g. computer science, engineering, social sciences, humanities, and more). Within computer science, HCI tends to focus on how to design useful technologies that solve problems and enable new possibilities across a wide range of human activities. This includes practical considerations around designing and building intuitive, accessible, and useful computer interfaces; as well as explorations into how emerging technologies might be applied in novel ways. That said, HCI is also about taking stock of the ways in which computing infrastructures shape and are shaped by individuals, institutions, and society -- particularly as these technologies become increasingly embedded in our lives.

This quarter, for the MSAI section of this course, we are going to think about HCI, from several different vantage points: 
1. The data practitioner -- who will be engaging in work across the AI  two different vantages points
2. The interface designer: 
3. From the perspective of a consultant who 

A philosopher and as an engineer.

> "his course introduces fundamental principles for designing and analyzing interactive systems. Topics include user-centered design, prototyping and evaluation techniques, usability, accessibility, and graphical design fundamentals. The course also reviews emerging areas of HCI research. Students will work in teams to design and test a user interface using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript."

### 1. Data
We will begin the course by taking a look at data: what it represents, how it's made, and what interactions it supports.

* Explainable / Interpretable ML (including how ppl understand uncertainty)
* Recommendation systems
* Continual learning models: https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2513

## Coursework
### 1. Team Project
The heart of this course is a quarter-long project. You will work in teams to design and test a novel user interface around and idea of your team's choosing. App design is an iterative process; you will build and test successively higher-fidelity prototypes over the quarter. Students who are not registered for course credit may not participate in the project.

### 2. Individual Homework Assignments
You will also work on individual homework assignments throughout the quarter. These assignments will be pretty varied -- some will be coding assignments to get you familiar with different technologies and design methods. Some will be written assignments that will ask you to analyze existing systems or examine a series of case studies. All of these assignments are intended to help you develop your thinking about design decisions and their tradeoffs. 

### 3. Lectures
I have selected course readings to deepen and expand your understanding of HCI fundamentals beyond what we cover in lecture. You are ex

### 4. Weekly Labs
On Fridays, you will be doing short activities and tutorials in your lab section. Some of the labs will help you install, configure, and build a 'full stack web application.' Other labs will involve designing, building, and testing versions of your final project. Lab attendance is required, but you may miss one lab without a grade penalty.

### 5. Readings
I have selected course readings to deepen and expand your understanding of HCI fundamentals beyond what we cover in lecture. You are ex....

## Expectations
* You will come to class prepared and ready to engage in an intellectual discussion about the readings and labs.
* You will complete all assignments on time and with interest, engagement, and intellectual curiosity.
* You will bring your unique expertise, perspectives, and experiences to class and share them with others, so that we might all gain from your perspectives.
* You will respect and seek to understand the unique perspectives and experiences of others.
* You will give your classmates the benefit of the doubt (about their competence and intentions) and can expect the same from them.
* All work that you submit will be your own original work; you will cite others’ work where appropriate.

## Getting Questions Answered
We hope

## Office Hours
Office hours and locations / Zoom links are posted <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/times-locations/">here</a>. See the course Canvas page for the Zoom password.

## Grading
Your course grade is calculated based on 200 points as follows:

{:.medium}
| **2 Projects** | 2 x 40 Points | 80 Points | 40% |
| **2 Quizzes** (of 3) | 2 x 30 Points (lowest score dropped) | 60 Points | 30% |
| **5 Homeworks** (of 6) | 5 x 8 Points (lowest score dropped) | 40 Points | 20% |
| **7 Tutorials** (of 9) | 7 x ~3 Points (lowest scores dropped) | 20 Points | 10% |
| | | **200 Points** | **100%** |

Final grades are assigned on a fixed scale: 93-100 is 
an A, 90-92.99 is an A-, 87-89.99 is a B+, etc. Some other logistics:

1. Final course grades will not be rounded or curved.
1. We will not be using the final exam time for this class.


## A Note on Class Recordings
The Provost's office has asked instructors to publish the following language in the syllabus:

> ### Class Recordings
> This class or portions of this class may be recorded by the instructor for educational purposes. These recordings will be shared only with students enrolled in the course and will be deleted at the end of the Spring Quarter, 2020 course. Your instructor will communicate how you can access the recordings.
>
> ### Policy On Unauthorized Student Recording of Classroom or other Academic Activities
> Unauthorized student recording of classroom or other academic activities (including advising sessions or office hours) is prohibited. Unauthorized recording is unethical and may also be a violation of University policy and state law. Students requesting the use of assistive technology as an accommodation should contact AccessibleNU. Unauthorized use of classroom recordings — including distributing or posting them — is also prohibited.  
>
> Under the University’s Copyright Policy, faculty own the copyright to instructional materials — including those resources created specifically for the purposes of instruction, such as syllabi, lectures and lecture notes, and presentations.  Students cannot copy, reproduce, display or distribute these materials. Students who engage in unauthorized recording, unauthorized use of a recording or unauthorized distribution of instructional materials will be referred to the appropriate University office for follow-up.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
Any student requesting accommodations related to a disability or other condition is required to register with AccessibleNU (847-467-5530) and provide professors with an accommodation notification from AccessibleNU, preferably within the first two weeks of class. All information will remain confidential.
