During the last five weeks of the course, you will be designing and implementing a final project of your choosing. The parameters of the project are described in detail in the [final project guidelines](../project-description).


## Instructions
This group proposal is similar to the 3-slide brainstorm you did for Lab 3, but a bit more detailed, and should incorporate the ideas of your entire group. Please answer each of the questions below:

### 1. Problem & Motivation
Describe the problem that your project would tackle, and the motivation for why that problem is important and interesting. This paragraph should discuss the current state of the world (the problem), as well as how and why the world would be better if some aspect of this problem were addressed (the goal). You should convince the reader that this is a worthwhile problem space to explore. When writing the section, please ensure that you've:

* Identified an actual problem
* Given sufficient detail so that your reader can actually understand why the problem is a problem
*  Identified a clear set of goals that you're hoping to address, given the problem you've identified.

### 2. Analysis of Related Work
This section should give your reader a lay of the land, including:

* The current status quo: how are people currently accomplishing the tasks you're hoping to support?
* How have others tried to innovate in this area (innovation can be defined broadly)? Existing alternatives to your proposed system should be acknowledged.
* What are the strengths and limitations of existing approaches?

### 3. Design Hypothesis
Describe your current idea for addressing the problem (i.e. your app idea). Remember, this is only a first guess at a possible solution. The point of this project is to go through a process of validating your design ideas and assumptions.

### 4. Describe the interactions you're hoping to support
Given the overarching goal of your system, list the finer-grained interactions that you will be focusing on in this class. For instance, if your're creating something like Yelp (which is a massive system), you might choose to scope your project to a few interactions that most interest you and your team. Shoot for 3-5. For instance:

* A way for a restaurant owner to promote their restaurant.
* A way for a customer to find a restaurant that matches their criteria.
* A way for a customer to review a restaurant.

### 5. Describe the resources that your system will be using
* TODO: see Bob's Resource Description stuff..

### 6. Are you planning to integrate ML functionality into your system?
Not all data-intensive problems are best solved through ML, but you are encouraged to think through whether and how various ML methods might be brought to bear on the problem. Please answer the following questions:

* Are you planning to use any ML methods in your system (yes / no)?
* If so, how do you see ML supporting the interactions listed above? Note that you don't have to implement the ML piece, but you do want to come up with ways of testing the effectiveness of an ML-powered interaction.


### 7. What do you still need to learn in 

5. What resources / tutorials will you be using to help you?
If you’re exploring an API, a library, or a framework, make sure that there are ample online resources / tutorials / documentation / sources of inspiration that can help you. Please list some links to relevant resources that you will draw upon as you pursue your project (based on your preliminary research).





6. What will you have made when you’re done? 
Be specific (# of screens, description of basic functionality). You will break this down into steps below.



7. What will your first deliverable be?



8. What will your second deliverable be?



9. What will your third deliverable be?









## Rubric
You will be assessed based on evidence that you put some time and effort into thinking about what you want to accomplish and what it might take to make it happen. You will be assessed on:

1. Completeness
2. Demonstrated attention and thought to the scope, nature, and breakdown of the tasks.
3. Evidence that you did some legwork to explore what kinds of examples, tutorials, and web resouces are out there.

## What to turn in
Please submit a link to a Google Doc (make sure it’s shared!) or as an uploaded file (e.g. Word Document).
