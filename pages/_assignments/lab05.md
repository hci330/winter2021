Today we will be practicing "Paper" prototyping techniques (your team assignment for the week). Please watch this video on Paper Prototyping by the Nielsen Norman Group (30 minutes). This video provides a lot of practical advice for how to design a paper prototype and test it with users, which will be very helpful in preparation for [P3](p3). I have also linked to a skimmable article with similar tips and content (by Babich). Image by Csaba HÃ¡zi.
