This week, you will be making a front end for your blog. 

## I. Get Set Up
<a class="nu-button" href="/winter2021/course-files/homework/hw02.zip">hw02.zip <i class="fas fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

Download the starter files, which you will integrate to your current app as follows:

### 1. Copy folders into your existing project
Save the `static` and `templates` directory in your cs330-web-app folder. Your directory structure should look something like this:

```shell
├── Procfile
├── README.md
├── app.py
├── db.py
├── models.py
├── requirements.txt
├── static
├── templates
├── testing
└── views
```

### 2. Edits your app.py file
You'll need to make 2 changes to your app.py file. First, make sure you import `render_template` from the `flask` module:

```python
# make sure you import render_template from flask
from flask import render_template
```

Next, add the routes below to map your front-end templates to url paths.I've included a sample `app.py` file for you to use as a guide. 

```python
@app.route('/')
def list_posts():
    return render_template('get-posts.html')

@app.route('/add-post/')
def create_post():
    return render_template('create-post.html')

@app.route('/post/')
def get_single_post():
    return render_template('post-detail.html')
```

**Note**: It is often the case that the "frontend" of a web app is completely separate from the "backend." However, for the sake of simplicity, we'll just keep everything together.

### 3. Verify that your front-end works
When you're done, run flask...

```shell
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
...and navigate to the root of your website...

<a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:5000/</a>

You should see the following screen...

### 4. Commit your changes to GitHub and Heroku

## II. Your Task
Note that I have already implemented GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for the Blog Post resource (see video). 
For this assignment, you will be creating the frontend for a blog commenting system. This will involve:
1. Displaying all of the comments for a particular blog post.
2. Allowing the user to delete a comment.
3. Allowing the user to add a comment.
