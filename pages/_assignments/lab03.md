## Part I. Before You Come to Lab
Before you come to lab on Friday, please prepare a 3-slide deck that describes an idea you're interested in working on. You don't have to be sure about your idea or know whether it's feasible. We're just doing a structured brainstorm to get everyone to discuss different ideas and possibilities. You're welcome to take a look at the [final project guidelines](../project-description), but don't worry too much about the details yet -- we're just in the "ideas phase."

### Slide 1. Idea
Describe your idea, including (a) who your users are, (b) the interactions you hope to support, and (c) the data/information resources your system will provide.

### Slide 2. Background, Justification, & Motivation
Give some background / motivation for your idea. Questions you should answer:

* Why is your idea interesting to you and worth pursuing? 
* What is the current status quo? In other words, how do things work now (without your proposed system), and how do you see your idea improving upon what currently exists?

### Slide 3. What you want to get out of the project 
Articulating what you most want to get out of the project is a useful exercise for you, and will help your potential teammates understand where you're coming from.
Things to convey here could include:
* Given your idea, how are you thinking about the human / user-facing aspects of applied ML/AI?
* Which aspects of your idea are you most interested in exploring?
    * Do you want to learn more about a particular method, approach, or technology? 
    * Are you more interested in solving a particular problem?
    * Something else?

## Part II: During Lab
On Friday, each of you will be presenting your ideas to one another, in groups of four. We will try to get through three rounds of brainstorms (we'll see how it goes). Cooper and I will be cycling through and listening to ideas.
