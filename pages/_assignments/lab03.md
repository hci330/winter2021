## Part I. Before You Come to Lab
Before you come to lab on Friday, please prepare a 3-slide deck that describes a project you're interested in working on. You don't have to be sure about your idea or know whether it's feasible. We're just doing a structured brainstorm to get folks talking. Also, you're welcome to take a look at the [final project guidelines](../project-description), but don't worry too much about the details yet -- we're just in the "ideas phase."

### Slide 1. Idea
Describe your idea, including (a) who your users are, (b) the interactions you hope to support, and (c) the data/information resources your system will provide.

### Slide 2. Background, Justification, & Motivation
Give some background / motivation for your idea. Questions you should answer:

* Why is your idea interesting to you and worth pursuing? 
* What is the current status quo, and how will your system improve upon it?

Think of this slide as the "because" clause: 

*"I believe that **X idea** will better support **Y interaction(s)** for **Z users** because ________________."*

### Slide 3. How You're thinking about the "human dimensions" of AI in your project 
Things to convey here could include:
* How you're thing about integrating ML/AI ideas into your project
* Which aspects of your idea you're most interested in exploring
    * Do you want to learn more about a particular method, approach, or library? 
    * Are you more interested in solving a particular problem and exploring a range of different approaches?

Communicating what you most want to get out of the project will be useful to you and potential teammates.

## Part II: During Lab
On Friday, each of you will be presenting your ideas to one another, in groups of four. We will try to get through three rounds of brainstorms (we'll see how it goes). Cooper and I will be cycling through and listening to ideas.
