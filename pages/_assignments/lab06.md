In this lab, you're going to instantiate some rules of usability and composition while continuing practicing your front-end web dev skills. 

## Part 1: Background
Please review the rules we discussed if needed:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th><a href="../lectures/week07-lecture01">Usability Principles</a></th>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>Affordances</li>
                <li>Visibility</li>
                <li>Feedback</li>
                <li>Conceptual Models</li>
                <li>Natural Mappings</li>
                <li>Constraints</li>
                <li>Consistency</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><a href="../lectures/week07-lecture02">Visual Design & Composition Principles</a></th>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>Composition rules (contrast, repetition, alignment, asymmetry)</li>
                <li>Color</li>
                <li>Font pairings</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Then, download and take a look at the sample code I have provided you. You don't have to use any of these samples, but if you're new to front-end design, these files can help you to get oriented with some HTML / CSS / JavaScript strategies.

### 1. layout-techniques
The `layout-techniques` folder contains some simple layouts and cards that you can adapt, modify, and style to fit your needs. In my opinion, CSS / HTML layouts are the most difficult part of CSS.

* [demo01-grid](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/layout-techniques/demo01-grid): simple layout
* [demo02-grid](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/layout-techniques/demo02-grid): alternative layout
* [demo03-flex-cards](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/layout-techniques/demo03-flex-cards): laying out cards that flow
* [demo04-flex-cards-styled](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/layout-techniques/demo04-flex-cards-styled): cards alternative
* [demo05-cards-photos](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/layout-techniques/demo05-cards-photos): cards with photos
* [demo06-hamburger-menu](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/layout-techniques/demo06-hamburger-menu): responsive menu for mobile navigation (shrink screen to test)

To get some additional support with layouts, refer to the course website, and in particular:
* [The box model](/winter2021/css-reference/box-model/)
* [Media queries](/winter/css-reference/media-queries/) for mobile layouts
* [CSS Grid](/winter2021/css-reference/css-grid/)
* [Flexbox](/winter2021/css-reference/flexbox/)
* [Text & fonts](/winter2021/css-reference/fonts/)

### 2. mockup-techniques
The `mockup-techniques` folder contains some JavaScript - DOM interactions that can help you to show / hide screens and/or dynamically adjust how your screen looks visually.

* [font-switcher](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/mockup-techniques/font-switcher): adjusting styles based on user interactions
* [theme-switcher](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/mockup-techniques/theme-switcher): adjusting classes based on user interactions
* [page-turner](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/mockup-techniques/page-turner): showing / hiding content on mouseover (or any user event).

### 3. third-party-integrations
The `third-party-integrations` folder contains some demos that show how you might integrate external data into your UI using the JavaScript fetch API.

* [01-photo-gallery](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/third-party-integrations/01-photo-gallery): using inline data.
* [02-gallery-ajax-flickr](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/third-party-integrations/02-gallery-ajax-flickr): using flickr data.
* [03-spotify-demo](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/third-party-integrations/03-spotify-demo): more advanced interactions using Spotify API.


## Part 2: Your Task
1. Pick one of the screens that you're planning to build first (for your P4 deliverable).
2. Create a layout for your screen (using today's samples or other resources).
3. As you do so, apply the composition and usability principles that we discussed this week, with particular attention to the rules of composition -- and particularly the principles of ***alignment*** and ***contrast***. Keep your screen organized, use white space liberally, and ensure that you're communicating what is background / foreground. Less is more! It's usually (though not always) better to have multiple screens and/or regions that you show and hide than to show the user all of the options / features at once.

## What to Submit
Submit what you came up with (just submit a zip file) to Canvas. It doesn't have to be perfect. Just a good faith effort to instantiate some design principles.
