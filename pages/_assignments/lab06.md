In this lab, you're going to instantiate some rules of usability and composition while continuing practicing your front-end web dev skills. 

## Part 1: Background
Please review the rules we discussed if needed:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th><a href="../lectures/week07-lecture01">Usability Principles</a></th>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>Affordances</li>
                <li>Visibility</li>
                <li>Feedback</li>
                <li>Conceptual Models</li>
                <li>Natural Mappings</li>
                <li>Constraints</li>
                <li>Consistency</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><a href="../lectures/week07-lecture02">Visual Design & Composition Principles</a></th>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>Composition rules (contrast, repetition, alignment, asymmetry)</li>
                <li>Color</li>
                <li>Font pairings</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Then download and take a look at the sample code I have provided you. You don't have to use any of it, but if you're new to front-end design, it will help you to get oriented with some HTML / CSS / JavaScript strategies.

### layout-techniques
The `layout-techniques` folder contains some simple layouts and cards that you are encouraged to adapt and modify. You don't have to use these samples, but they may help, as layouts are a little bit convoluted in CSS.
* [demo01-grid](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/layout-techniques/demo01-grid): simple layout
* [demo02-grid](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/layout-techniques/demo02-grid): alternative layout
* [demo03-flex-cards](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/layout-techniques/demo03-flex-cards): laying out cards that flow
* [demo04-flex-cards-styled](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/layout-techniques/demo04-flex-cards-styled): cards alternative
* [demo05-cards-photos](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/layout-techniques/demo05-cards-photos): cards with photos
* [demo06-hamburger-menu](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/layout-techniques/demo06-hamburger-menu): responsive menu for mobile navigation (shrink screen to test)

### mockup-techniques
The `mockup-techniques` folder contains some JavaScript - DOM interactions that can help you to show / hide screens

* [font-switcher](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/mockup-techniques/font-switcher): adjusting styles based on user interactions
* [theme-switcher](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/mockup-techniques/theme-switcher): adjusting classes based on user interactions
* [page-turner](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/mockup-techniques/page-turner): showing / hiding content on mouseover (or any user event).

### third-party-integrations
The `third-party-integrations` folder contains some demos that show how you might integrate external data into your UI using the JavaScript fetch API.

* [01-photo-gallery](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/third-party-integrations/01-photo-gallery): using inline data.
* [02-gallery-ajax-flickr](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/third-party-integrations/02-gallery-ajax-flickr): using flickr data.
* [03-spotify-demo](/winter2021/course-files/labs/lab06/third-party-integrations/03-spotify-demo): more advanced interactions using Spotify API.


## Part 2: Your Task
1. Pick one of the screens that you've mocked up (or are planning to mock up) in Balsamiq.
2. Implement it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. As you do so, apply the composition and usability principles that we discussed this week. While this assignment may not motivate the usability principles, you should be able to implement some of the rules of composition. 

Specifically:
