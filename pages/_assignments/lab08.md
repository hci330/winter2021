Today you'll be testing the second version of your high-fidelity prototype in lab.

Be sure to take notes, as you'll need to write up your observations and resolutions for your team submission this week.

## Part 1: User Testing
Split into two rooms and complete your final round of user testing.

### Breakout Room 1 (with Cooper)
* Podility
* Online Discussions
* Data Labeling System

### Breakout Room 2 (with Sarah)

* Court Transparency
* LVAD Data Visualization
* Cluster Visualization

## Part 2: Hatching a plan for next week
There are a few things we need to figure out for next week:
* Priorities for Monday and Wednesday
    * Special topics?
    * Technical / design workshops?
* Make sure that the revised scope of your final deliverable is clear to you and to us.
