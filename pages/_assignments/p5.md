## Instructions
The instructions for this assignment are almost identical to [those in P3](p3), with two exceptions:
1. You will implement at least 1 additional feature (the number will vary depending on the size of your team) to support additional tasks relevant to your scenarios.
2. You will include a reflection on your observations from user testing during studio the previous week (see steps 6 and 7 below).

## What to Hand In
Submit a document to Canvas that includes the following:

1. **Task**<br> A brief description of the task scenario you chose to implement for P6.
2. **Component**<br> A brief description of the component you chose to implement for P6.
3. **Link**<br>A link to your team's **project_6** branch. 
4. **Platform**<br>The platform we should use to view your prototype (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.)
5. **Design Summary**<br>Write one paragraph about how your prototype for this task scenario and component applies Norman's user interface design principles, and one paragraph about how your prototype applies the graphic design principles covered in class (you should have exactly two paragraphs, no more, no less). You do not have to mention all of the principles, just tell us how you were thinking about and applying some these principles as you were working on your prototype.
6. **Observations**<br>A written description of the usability problems you discovered from testing in studio last week. Use screenshots of your computer prototype to illustrate your observations.
7. **Resolutions**<br>What did you learn about the parts of your interface from this prototype (from testing last week)? Propose design solutions for the usability problems you found.
